<br />
PC-Engine Assembly Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass assembler by byuu.<br />
I use a special version of bass by ARM9 which has been updated with PCE HuC6280 output:<br />
https://github.com/ARM9/bass<br />
I have included binaries of all the demos.<br />
<br />
I used the PCEDEV wiki to help get me started: http://www.archaicpixels.com<br />
<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.pce) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real PC-Engine using a flash cartridge.<br />
<br />
You can use PC-Engine emulators like MAME PCE Driver.
